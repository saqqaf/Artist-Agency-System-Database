# Artist-Agency-System-Database
This is s small project of designing a database for an artist agency system


In this project, we will build a database for a company that is called FAME. FAME is a company that deals with artists.
They look for prospect artists and sign contracts with them. Then they provide their services to clients who are looking for artists to perform in their events.
In this project, we will start first by designing the data enterprise model of the database.
Then, we will build the entity relation diagram (ERD) and the enhanced version of it (EERD). After that, we will extract the relation schema from the EERD.
The last step will be the implementation where we will write the SQL code to create the database.
